##  Week Twelve Homework - Loops

### Objectives
Learn about for loops and how we can use them to repeat tasks, and iterate over arrays.

### Description
Complete the instructions in the javascript file to add new students to the class and  display them on the page.

If you need bonus tasks:
* Update the array and the displayStudents function so the page shows both student images and names.
* Update the add student section to allow users to give an image with the student names
* Also update the page so you can remove a students and then re-display the page.
